# Project AI Instructions

These instructions tailor AI assistance for this multi-project workspace.

## Structure

This wonkspace contains many projects.  See [[docs/overview.md]] for their description.

- Each project directory is its own git repo. (E.g. /.github is only for workspace copilot instructions).
- Some of these may have github uplinks.
- All other files (ie. those not belonging to one of the subprojects) are included in the .git repo for this workspace.
- These files are generally descriptive, and not code files.

## 1. Understanding the context
- docs/overview.md explains the overall goals.
